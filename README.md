vim-mde-syntax
==============

Syntax highlighting for MarkdownExtended files in VIM.

**!! - This is a work-in-progress, please do not use this plugin for now ...**

Dev notes
---------

The `mde.vim` syntax definition file is based on existing `markdown.vim` by Tim Pope,
based itself on existing `html.vim` by Claudio Fleiner.

How-to
------

To install ("test" actually) the syntax definition:

-   copy the `syntax/mde.vim` file in your "$HOME/.vim/syntax/" directory
-   copy the `ftdetect/mde.vim` file in your "$HOME/.vim/ftdetect/" directory

The syntax is (for now) designed to be applied on every `FILENAME.mde` file.
